# Bytecode
Once we have a parse tree ready, we convert everything into
bytecode. This bytecode has scopes instead of labels. This is relevant.

Currently the bytecode is still not that well formed. [tests/example.posm](/tests/example.posm) has some readable assembly (posm = **p**roof **o**f \[concept] \[a]**s**se**m**bly).
